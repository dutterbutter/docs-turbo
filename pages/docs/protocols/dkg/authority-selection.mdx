# Authority Selection

The authority selection system for DKG authorities uses a simple reputation mechanism for selecting the best set
of authorities to participate in the key generation and signing protocols. The integer thresholds for keygen authorities
and signing authorities are set and governed on-chain and directly correspond to the number of DKG clients that will
participate in either protocols.

For a keygen threshold of **_n_** and a signing threshold of **_t_**, we take the top-**_n_** authorities on chain by
reputation. Out of these **_n_** keygen authorities, **_t+1_** of them are selected for signing. The keygen set remains
fixed over the course of the session, whereas the signing set can change amidst misbehaviours in signing protocol participation.
