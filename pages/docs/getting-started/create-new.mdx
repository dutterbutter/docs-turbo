# Creating a new monorepo

To create a new monorepo, use our [`create-turbo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-turbo) npm package:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

You can also clone a Turborepo starter repository to get a head start on your monorepo. To see Turborepo examples and starters, see the [Turborepo examples directory on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples).
