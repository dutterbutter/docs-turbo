## Logs and Troubleshooting

You will see logs from both the relay chain and the parachain. The relay chain will be prefixed by [Relaychain], while the parachain has no prefix.
If you would like to run the node with verbose logs you may add the following arguments during initial setup. You may change the target to include `debug | error | info| trace | warn`.

```
-ldkg=debug \
-ldkg_metadata=debug \
-lruntime::offchain=debug \
-ldkg_proposal_handler=debug \
-ldkg_proposals=debug
```

### P2P Ports Not Open

If you don't see an Imported message (without the [Relaychain] tag), you need to check the P2P port configuration. P2P port must be open to incoming traffic.

### In Sync

Both chains must be in sync at all times, and you should see either Imported or Idle messages and have connected peers.

### Genesis Mismatching

If you notice similar log messages as below:

```
DATE [Relaychain] Bootnode with peer id `ID` is on a different
chain (our genesis: 0x3f5... theirs: 0x45j...)
```

This typically means that you are running an older version and will need to upgrade.
