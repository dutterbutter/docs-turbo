# Imports

Turbopack supports CJS and ESM imports out of the box, and offers partial support for AMD.

Turbopack bundles your application, so imports won't be resolved to native browser ESM. You can learn why in our [bundling vs Native ESM](/pack/docs/why-turbopack#bundling-vs-native-esm) section.

## CommonJS

Turbopack supports the `require` syntax out-of-the-box:

```ts
const { add } = require('./math');

add(1, 2);
```

We also support dynamic `require()` syntax, for if you want to import a dynamically named asset:

```ts
const imgName = getRandomImgName();

const img = require(`./images/${imgName}.png`);
```

## ESM

Importing via the `import` syntax is also supported out-of-the-box. This includes static assets, and `import type`:

```ts
import img from './img.png';

import type { User } from '../server/types';

import { z } from 'zod';
```

## Dynamic Imports

Can be totally dynamic:

```
import(`./dir/${file}.js`)
```

Only in client-side code

## `imports` field in `package.json`

We don't support `imports` maps! But not that many people use them anyway.

## `exports` maps

We support this!
