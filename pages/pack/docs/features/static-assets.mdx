# Static Assets

`import img from './img.png'` is supported

BUT `import img from './img.png'` will return a string, not an object containing `src`

Custom suffixes are not supported.

Special queries are not supported yet, but link to TC39 proposal: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-reflection

We'll be paying close attention to that proposal.

## Public directory

Supported!

## JSON

Can import json
