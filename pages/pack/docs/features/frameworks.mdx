# Frameworks

## React

### JSX/TSX

`.jsx` and `.tsx` files are supported out-of-the-box with Turbopack. We use [SWC](https://swc.rs/) to compile your JavaScript and TypeScript code, which results in extremely fast compilation.

Similar to Next.js, Turbopack doesn't require you to import React in order to use JSX:

```diff filename="src/index.tsx"
- import React from 'react';

const Component = () => {
  return <div />
}
```
